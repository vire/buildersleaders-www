BuildersLeaders Code of Conduct
===============================

This community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience or everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

How To Behave
-------------

Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.

Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.

If you're not sure, ask someone instead of assuming.

Community members are expected to not abuse this community to head-hunt and hire other community member and also not use it as a place to look for a job opportunity.

Consequences And Enforcement
----------------------------

Violations of the Code of Conduct may be reported by contacting the team via sending an email to ADD-EMAIL-HERE. All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

As organizers, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can't foresee every situation, and thus if in the organizers' judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so. We donâ€™t like playing bad cop so please don't put us in this position.
